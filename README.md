# PIMNet_AnimalDetector

Created by EunSeop and [Daijin Kim](http://imlab.postech.ac.kr/members_d.htm) at [POSTECH IM Lab](http://imlab.postech.ac.kr)

### Overview
We propose a new object detection method based on [YOLOv2](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet) that extracts features through base network and a hourglass method robust to small object detection. To improve the performance of Recall, we use anchor boxes to detect object.

### Performance
Comparison of the number of DCNNs, the number of images, the dimensionality of feature, and the accuracy of the proposed method with the state-of-the-art on the LFW.
